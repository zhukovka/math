        <h3>Function</h3>
        <p>A <b>function</b> is a rule that assigns each element in one set to a unique element in a second set.</p>
        <p>Understanding this definition depends on knowing the meanings of the words rule, assigns, and unique.</p>
        <p>A function is a set of ordered pairs in which no two ordered pairs have the same first coordinate and
            different second coordinates.</p>

        <p>A graph is the graph of a function if and only if there is no vertical line that crosses the graph more than
            once.
        </p>
        <p>This criterion is known as the <b>vertical line test</b>.</p>

        <h5>Domain and Range</h5>
        <p>A relation is a set of ordered pairs. The <b>domain</b> of a relation is the set of all first coordinates of
            the
            ordered pairs. The <b>range</b> of a relation is the set of all second coordinates of the ordered pairs.</p>

            The Average Rate of Change of a Function
        </h5>

        <p>If \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) are two ordered pairs of a function, we define the average rate of
            change
            of the function as \(x\) varies from \(x_1\) to \(x_2\), as the change in \(y\)-coordinates divided by the
            change in
            \(x\)-coordinates, \(\Delta x / \Delta y\): $${y_2 - y_1 \over x_2 - x_1}.$$</p>
